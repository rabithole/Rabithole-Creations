            <h2>Schooling:</h2>
                <p>
            Presently I am working towards an <em>AAS in Web Design and Development</em> from Portland Community College. My focus has been to first take the courses that directly relate to a real world working environment. As of fall 2014, I have completed course instruction and work involving all the skills in the title above. <em>I enjoy hand coding</em> from scratch and that has led me to focus on <em>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP</em>. <span>I am looking for a team work environment that will allow me to continue learning.</span>
                </p>
            <h2>Problem Solving:</h2>
            	<p>
                Anyone with experience knows this is a very important <em>real world skill</em>. My skill as a problem solver has been honed from many years as an automotive technician. Yes, there is a difference between an auto tech and a mechanic, and that is the ability to problem solve. This is known in the field of automotive as diagnosing. This skill includes the ability to learn new information and quickly apply it to working projects. 
                </p>
            <h2>Photography:</h2>
            	<p>
                I began taking pictures in high school and have been doing so ever since. Most of my experience involves natural light, but I have recently been looking for the opportunity to extend my skills to product photography. You can see some of my photography by clicking the photography link above. I have recently been building my skills in <em>image processing using Photoshop and Bridge</em>.
                </p>
            <h2>Computer Experience:</h2>
            	<p>
                I have been building and repairing custom PCâ€™s for the better part of a decade. My current machine is a business class work station with a RAID setup for speed and redundant backup. Complete with a backup power supply that will save all information and auto shutdown.

        My portraits have been about catching those moments that are fleeting in life. I pride myself in being able to have the camera settings right for those moments when the conditions are in perpetual flux. The only photo in this section that was planned is the last picture of the farmer girl Chyann. I really appreciated the tasteful way she pulled it off. It really was a Halloween costume.

        <p>
        Landscapes abound. The outdoors is something I really enjoy. Like the portraits, they are about capturing those moments that we pass over so quickly. These moments happen everyday, but we are just to busy to stop and take them in. With the exception of the red desert scene, all these photos are from everyday places around Portland Oregon.

        <p>
        Night shots are a lot of fun. They stretch your skills as a photographer and further your understanding of how bright a light is compared to total darkness. There is a delicate balance that needs to be achieved for the correct exposure. Just because the suns not up, doesn't mean there isn't much color to be had.

        <p>
        Water is one of my favorite subjects to photograph. It provides many textures, reflections and transparencies you won't find any place else. Water can effectively double the amount of color in any seen creating very dramatic effects. Capturing the many textures that water creates is very challenging.

             <p>
        Sunsets pose a unique challenge due to their often dramatic differences between darks and brights. I have turned to HDR to address this challenge. Coming from film, it is natural to feel as though using some digital techniques are somehow to easy or cheating. But then I realized the goal as a photographer has always been to recreate the moment as it was. Digital photography has made this goal possible in many ways. As with any tool, it can be abused. Although that is a matter of preference.

             <p> <a href="http://www.vista-park.org" target="_blank"><img src="images/web_projects/vista.jpg" alt="Vista Park Campground"></a>
           Vista Park is an RV, tent and yurt campground located in the quaint little town of Skamokawa Washington. Operated by Port #2 of Wahkiakum County this project was a complete redesign. With great views and an amazing beach, I saw the need for extensive photography. Photographs were initially taken in RAW format then processed in Photoshop. Photoshop was used to process photos, create the Vista Park logo, park map, panoramas in the events page and the 360 panorama on the park photos page.  
            </p>
            <p>
             I created a park map using Photoshop to create an overlay over a Google Earth image. The maps layout is geographically accurate do to the method used in its creation. The printable map used by the office was given a few adjustments to aid the park staff in giving directions to visitors.   
            </p>
            <p>
            Much time was spent on the navigation as it is entirely done with CSS. I utilized code I had used in a class project. It was an extensive learning experience with nested lists and hidden elements. The right color combination was key as it needed to work on every page of the site. 
            </p>
            <p> 
           <span> I spent my summer 2014 term intensively applying SEO techniques to this site. Utilizing Google Webmaster tools and eventually integrating some Micro data using schema.org. I acquired tons of data and was able to increase traffic to the site with a combination of Facebook marketing and an effective landing page. The data showed site visitors predominately landed on the main page first and progressed to key parts of the site to find various camping information they might need for their stay. The scope of this project didn't allow me to explore other social media outlets. Something I know is important, depending on the project.</span>

            County Line Park is also owned by Port #2 of Wahkiakum County. A much smaller park that is favored by fisherman due to it's close access to the Columbia River. It did not require a site as extensive as Vista Park or a separate business image. I created a sub domain for this site, both to save money and as a learning exercise I utilized the templates I created for Vista Park to quickly create this site. By doing so I kept a common theme for Port #2 in an effort that visitors might make the connection that these two parks are part of the same operation.

            This was my first ever project to go live on the web. It involved some very specific instructions from the client who had a Graphic Designer work with me in its design. They are located in Southern California and required a trip there to take all the photos in a two day span. All processing was done by me. Overall I am satisfied with them. I learned a lot with this experience and look forward to applying what I learned toward my next product photography venture. I utilized squareup.com for their online store. I hope to learn to create custom online stores in the future.

            This is the second site I created. A family run operation that simply enjoys the lifestyle. Alpaca's were advertised as a great investment opportunity that died in the 2008 banking crash. I learned a lot about CSS when creating this site. In particular, how the mouse hover event could be used to expose hidden objects. This was the first time I used a photograph as a background picture for a site. What I learned here I have applied to responsive design techniques.

            A new business located in Wahkiakum County, disappointedly I wasn't able to finish this site. What is here are pages designed to give the owners some different looks to consider. This site is unfinished and was suppose to evolve as the business took shape. Unfortunately I was caught in the internal turmoil between the partners. Now this site exists on my computer alone. I learned much about CSS positioning with this site and pushed my boundaries in stylizing pages using CSS. It was the request of the owners that it would be very artistic. I received positive feedback up until the partners decided to part ways. Overall it was a good learning experience for me in regards to client dynamics.

        <h1>Graphic Designs</h1>
        <p>
        	My career aspirations are to be a web developer. I feel my design skills are worth mentioning regardless. These projects are my most recent work. My earlier studies were as an illustrator in the early 90's. Life took me another direction. What I learned during that time has not been forgotten. Having natural artistic ability, I have kept in touch with these skills with personal projects. I have only recently began utilizing these skills in Photoshop. It has been a fun endeavour and I would not think twice about taking part in a project where my role would striclty be design oriented.

        I have taken all the classes ,within my major, relating to a real world work environment from Portland Community College (PCC). At the same time, I have applied what I have learned in these courses to real world projects for various clients. Each project had learning goals designed to further my understanding of real world technologis for the web. Having a solid understanding of HTML5 and CSS3, I am now focusing on JavaScript and my understanding of general programming principles.

        Prior to my career as an automotive technician, I <em>studied design</em> along side automotive repair at Pasadena City College in Southern Californina. Oportunities in the field of automotive pulled me that direction and I enjoyed a successful career for many years.
